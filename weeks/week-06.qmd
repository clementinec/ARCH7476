## Today's Agenda



- Data visualization principles for architecture

- From numbers to compelling figures

- Object Card design workshop

- A4 figure development

- Guest speaker: Data visualization designer

---

## The Communication Challenge

**Your stakeholders are busy:**



- 30 seconds to grab attention

- 2 minutes to understand key points

- 5 minutes for detailed evidence

- Must be actionable and memorable

**Your data is complex:**


- Multiple variables and conditions


- Uncertainty and limitations

- Technical details and context

- Competing priorities and trade-offs

---

## Visualization Principles for Architecture

---

### Architecture-Specific Considerations

**Spatial thinking:**



- Use plans, sections, and 3D views

- Show scale and proportion clearly

- Connect data to familiar building elements

**Performance focus:**


- Emphasize outcomes that matter to users

- Show before/after or alternative comparisons

- Include relevant benchmarks and targets

**Decision support:**


- Highlight actionable insights

- Show confidence levels and uncertainty

- Provide clear recommendations

---

### Hierarchy and Focus

**Primary message:**


- What's the most important finding?

- How can you make this immediately visible?

- What should viewers remember if they see nothing else?

**Supporting details:**


- What context helps interpret the main finding?

- What evidence supports your conclusions?

- What limitations should be acknowledged?

---

## Object Card Design Workshop

---

### What is an Object Card?

**Single-page visual summary** of your entire research project:


- Design object with key findings

- Decision recommendations

- Method transparency

- Contact information for details

**Purpose:**


- Portfolio piece demonstrating research skills

- Conference poster or presentation slide

- Client handout or summary document

- Professional networking tool

---

### Object Card Elements

**Visual identity:**


- High-quality image of your design object

- Consistent typography and color scheme

- Clear title and subtitle

- Professional layout and composition

**Evidence summary:**


- Key performance metrics prominently displayed

- Before/after or alternative comparisons

- Clear indication of confidence levels

- Most important findings highlighted

---

### Design Process

**Step 1: Content hierarchy**


- List all information you want to include

- Rank by importance to stakeholders

- Eliminate bottom 50% ruthlessly

**Step 2: Visual sketching**


- Try 3-4 completely different layouts

- Vary emphasis and organization

- Test readability at poster scale

**Step 3: Refinement**


- Choose strongest layout concept

- Polish typography and alignment

- Check color accessibility and printing

---

## Excel/Sheets Visualization Excellence

---

### Beyond Basic Charts

**Heat maps for spatial data:**


- Use conditional formatting for performance zones

- Show building floor plans with performance overlay

- Color-code performance levels intuitively

**Small multiples for comparisons:**


- Multiple small charts showing different conditions

- Consistent scales and formatting across charts

- Easy visual comparison of patterns

**Error bars and confidence intervals:**


- Show uncertainty in your measurements

- Use standard deviation or confidence ranges

- Label uncertainty sources clearly

---

### Professional Chart Design

**Typography:**


- Sans-serif fonts for readability

- Consistent font sizes and hierarchy

- No unnecessary text or labels

**Color strategy:**


- Use color to highlight key findings

- Maintain accessibility (colorblind-friendly)

- Consistent color meanings across charts

**Clarity over decoration:**


- Remove unnecessary gridlines and backgrounds

- Simplify legends and annotations

- Make data the visual focus

---

## Hands-On Visualization Lab

---

### Exercise 1: Chart Makeover

**Individual work (20 minutes):**

- Take one chart from your current analysis

- Apply professional design principles

- Focus on clarity and stakeholder relevance

- Prepare 1-minute presentation of improvement

---

### Exercise 2: Object Card Sketch

**Individual work (25 minutes):**

- Create hand-drawn layout sketch for your Object Card

- Include all required elements

- Test visual hierarchy and balance

- Consider how it would look at poster scale

---

### Exercise 3: Peer Critique

**Pairs (15 minutes):**

- Exchange sketches and provide feedback

- Focus on clarity and visual impact

- Suggest improvements for stakeholder communication

- Identify strongest elements to develop further

---

## A4 Package Integration

---

### Four Component Synergy

**Research Brief:** Comprehensive analysis and recommendations
**Practice Case:** Two-slide executive summary
**Object Card:** Visual poster for broad audiences
**Reproducibility Capsule:** Complete method documentation

**Key:** All components must tell consistent story with appropriate detail level

---

### Visual Consistency Strategy

**Develop visual identity:**

- Consistent color palette across components

- Standard typography and layout principles

- Unified style for charts and graphics

- Professional presentation standards

**Content coordination:**

- Same key findings emphasized across formats

- Consistent terminology and metrics

- Aligned recommendations and action items

- Cross-references between components

---

## Advanced Visualization Techniques

---

### Showing Change Over Time

**Before/after comparisons:**


- Side-by-side layouts for clear contrast

- Arrows or visual connections showing change

- Quantified improvement metrics

**Time series analysis:**


- Line charts for continuous monitoring data

- Seasonal patterns and trend identification

- Baseline and intervention periods marked clearly

---

### Spatial Performance Visualization

**Building section analysis:**


- Overlay performance data on architectural drawings

- Color-code zones by performance levels

- Show user experience at human scale

**Neighborhood scale mapping:**


- Use GIS tools for urban context

- Show building location relative to infrastructure

- Include demographic and environmental context

---

## Communication Strategy Development

---

### Stakeholder-Specific Formatting

**For developers:**


- ROI and financial performance emphasis

- Risk mitigation and market advantage
