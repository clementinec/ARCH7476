## Today's Agenda

- Data visualization principles for architecture
- From numbers to compelling figures
- Object Card design workshop
- A4 figure development
- Guest speaker: Data visualization designer

---

## The Communication Challenge

**Your stakeholders are busy:**

- 30 seconds to grab attention
- 2 minutes to understand key points
- 5 minutes for detailed evidence
- Must be actionable and memorable

**Your data is complex:**
- Multiple variables and conditions

- Uncertainty and limitations
- Technical details and context
- Competing priorities and trade-offs

---

## Visualization Principles for Architecture

---

### Architecture-Specific Considerations

**Spatial thinking:**

- Use plans, sections, and 3D views
- Show scale and proportion clearly
- Connect data to familiar building elements

**Performance focus:**

- Emphasize outcomes that matter to users
- Show before/after or alternative comparisons
- Include relevant benchmarks and targets

**Decision support:**

- Highlight actionable insights
- Show confidence levels and uncertainty
- Provide clear recommendations

---

### Hierarchy and Focus

**Primary message:**

- What's the most important finding?
- How can you make this immediately visible?
- What should viewers remember if they see nothing else?

**Supporting details:**

- What context helps interpret the main finding?
- What evidence supports your conclusions?
- What limitations should be acknowledged?

---

## Object Card Design Workshop

---

### What is an Object Card?

**Single-page visual summary** of your entire research project:

- Design object with key findings
- Decision recommendations
- Method transparency
- Contact information for details

**Purpose:**

- Portfolio piece demonstrating research skills
- Conference poster or presentation slide
- Client handout or summary document
- Professional networking tool

---

### Object Card Elements

**Visual identity:**

- High-quality image of your design object
- Consistent typography and color scheme
- Clear title and subtitle
- Professional layout and composition

**Evidence summary:**

- Key performance metrics prominently displayed
- Before/after or alternative comparisons
- Clear indication of confidence levels
- Most important findings highlighted

---

### Design Process

**Step 1: Content hierarchy**

- List all information you want to include
- Rank by importance to stakeholders
- Eliminate bottom 50% ruthlessly

**Step 2: Visual sketching**

- Try 3-4 completely different layouts
- Vary emphasis and organization
- Test readability at poster scale

**Step 3: Refinement**

- Choose strongest layout concept
- Polish typography and alignment
- Check color accessibility and printing

---

## Excel/Sheets Visualization Excellence

---

### Beyond Basic Charts

**Heat maps for spatial data:**

- Use conditional formatting for performance zones
- Show building floor plans with performance overlay
- Color-code performance levels intuitively

**Small multiples for comparisons:**

- Multiple small charts showing different conditions
- Consistent scales and formatting across charts
- Easy visual comparison of patterns

**Error bars and confidence intervals:**

- Show uncertainty in your measurements
- Use standard deviation or confidence ranges
- Label uncertainty sources clearly

---

### Professional Chart Design

**Typography:**

- Sans-serif fonts for readability
- Consistent font sizes and hierarchy
- No unnecessary text or labels

**Color strategy:**

- Use color to highlight key findings
- Maintain accessibility (colorblind-friendly)
- Consistent color meanings across charts

**Clarity over decoration:**

- Remove unnecessary gridlines and backgrounds
- Simplify legends and annotations
- Make data the visual focus

<!-- ## Guest Speaker Session

**Professional Data Visualization Designer**

*[30-minute presentation + Q&A]*

**Topics:**

- Real-world architectural visualization projects
- Client communication strategies
- Tool workflows and efficiency tips
- Portfolio development for design research -->
 -->
---

## Hands-On Visualization Lab

---

### Exercise 1: Chart Makeover

**Individual work (20 minutes):**
- Take one chart from your current analysis
- Apply professional design principles
- Focus on clarity and stakeholder relevance
- Prepare 1-minute presentation of improvement

---

### Exercise 2: Object Card Sketch

**Individual work (25 minutes):**
- Create hand-drawn layout sketch for your Object Card
- Include all required elements
- Test visual hierarchy and balance
- Consider how it would look at poster scale

---

### Exercise 3: Peer Critique

**Pairs (15 minutes):**
- Exchange sketches and provide feedback
- Focus on clarity and visual impact
- Suggest improvements for stakeholder communication
- Identify strongest elements to develop further

---

## A4 Package Integration

---

### Four Component Synergy

**Research Brief:** Comprehensive analysis and recommendations
**Practice Case:** Two-slide executive summary
**Object Card:** Visual poster for broad audiences
**Reproducibility Capsule:** Complete method documentation

**Key:** All components must tell consistent story with appropriate detail level

---

### Visual Consistency Strategy

**Develop visual identity:**
- Consistent color palette across components
- Standard typography and layout principles
- Unified style for charts and graphics
- Professional presentation standards

**Content coordination:**
- Same key findings emphasized across formats
- Consistent terminology and metrics
- Aligned recommendations and action items
- Cross-references between components

---

## Advanced Visualization Techniques

---

### Showing Change Over Time

**Before/after comparisons:**

- Side-by-side layouts for clear contrast
- Arrows or visual connections showing change
- Quantified improvement metrics

**Time series analysis:**

- Line charts for continuous monitoring data
- Seasonal patterns and trend identification
- Baseline and intervention periods marked clearly

---

### Spatial Performance Visualization

**Building section analysis:**

- Overlay performance data on architectural drawings
- Color-code zones by performance levels
- Show user experience at human scale

**Neighborhood scale mapping:**

- Use GIS tools for urban context
- Show building location relative to infrastructure
- Include demographic and environmental context

---

## Communication Strategy Development

---

### Stakeholder-Specific Formatting

**For developers:**

- ROI and financial performance emphasis
- Risk mitigation and market advantage
- Regulatory compliance confirmation
- Implementation timeline and costs

**For architects:**

- Design flexibility and creative opportunities
- Integration with design process
- Technical specifications and details
- Performance optimization strategies

**For users:**

- Comfort and satisfaction impacts
- Health and wellbeing benefits
- Usability and accessibility improvements
- Environmental quality enhancements

---

### Presentation Adaptation
