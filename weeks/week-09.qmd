## Today's Agenda

- Practice Case development workshop
- Narrative structure and flow
- Figure and presentation clinic
- Peer Review Session #2
- Object Card finalization

---

## The Two-Slide Challenge

---

### Practice Case Purpose

**Distill your entire semester into two slides** that communicate:
- What problem you investigated
- What evidence you found
- What stakeholders should do about it
- Why they should trust your recommendation

**Audience:** Busy decision-makers with 2-3 minutes maximum

---

### Slide 1: The Problem and Evidence

**Visual elements:**
- Clear image of your design object
- Key performance data or findings
- Before/after or alternative comparisons
- Confidence indicators or error bars

**Text elements:**
- One-sentence problem statement
- 2-3 key findings with metrics
- Stakeholder relevance statement

---

### Slide 2: Decision Recommendations

**Visual elements:**
- Decision matrix or recommendation summary
- Implementation timeline or process diagram
- Contact information and next steps
- Professional branding/identity

**Text elements:**
- Specific actionable recommendations
- Implementation requirements or considerations
- Success criteria or monitoring approach

---

## Narrative Structure Workshop

---

### The Research Story Arc

**Setup:** What problem needs solving and why?
**Investigation:** How did you systematically study it?
**Discovery:** What did you find that was surprising or important?
**Resolution:** What should stakeholders do with this knowledge?
**Future:** What questions remain and what comes next?

---

### Stakeholder-Centered Narrative

**Start with their problem:**
- What decision are they trying to make?
- What constraints or pressures do they face?
- What information do they currently lack?

**Show your solution:**
- How does your evidence address their specific needs?
- What confidence can they have in your findings?
- How does this compare to their current approach?

**End with their action:**
- What specific steps should they take?
- What resources or support do they need?
- How will they know if it's working?

---

### Exercise: Elevator Pitch Development

**Individual work (15 minutes):**
Create 60-second verbal summary covering:
1. **Hook:** Why should they care? (15 seconds)
2. **Evidence:** What did you find? (30 seconds)  
3. **Action:** What should they do? (15 seconds)

**Partner practice (15 minutes):**
- Deliver pitch to classmate
- Get feedback on clarity and persuasiveness
- Refine based on listener questions

---

## Figure and Presentation Clinic

---

### Individual Consultation Sessions

**5-minute sessions with instructor:**
- Bring 1-2 key figures needing improvement
- Focus on clarity and stakeholder relevance
- Get specific suggestions for enhancement
- Plan implementation priorities

**While waiting:**
- Work on Object Card layout refinement
- Practice elevator pitch delivery
- Review and polish existing figures

---

### Common Figure Issues and Solutions

**Problem:** "Chart shows data but no clear message"
**Solution:** Add annotation highlighting key finding, use color to emphasize important data

**Problem:** "Too much information crammed into one figure"
**Solution:** Split into multiple focused figures, use small multiples approach

**Problem:** "Uncertainty not communicated"
**Solution:** Add error bars, confidence intervals, or scenario ranges

**Problem:** "Not relevant to architectural decisions"  
**Solution:** Connect to building elements, show spatial relationships, include human scale

---

## Peer Review Session #2

---

### Review Focus Areas

**Narrative coherence:**
- Does the story flow logically from problem to solution?
- Are transitions clear between sections?
- Is the stakeholder relevance obvious throughout?

**Evidence quality:**
- Are claims supported by appropriate evidence?
- Is uncertainty acknowledged and communicated?
- Are limitations addressed honestly?

**Communication effectiveness:**
- Would busy practitioners understand key points quickly?
- Are figures clear and professionally presented?
- Are recommendations specific and actionable?

---

### Review Process

**Phase 1: Exchange materials (5 minutes)**
- Share A4 draft and Practice Case slides
- Provide context for reviewer about your stakeholder audience
- Specify what kind of feedback would be most helpful

**Phase 2: Review and feedback (25 minutes)**
- Read through materials carefully
- Focus on clarity and stakeholder relevance
- Note specific suggestions for improvement
- Identify strongest elements to maintain

**Phase 3: Discussion and clarification (15 minutes)**
- Discuss feedback verbally
- Clarify any confusing points
- Brainstorm solutions for identified problems

---
