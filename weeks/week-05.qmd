## Today's Agenda

- Pilot study results sharing
- Troubleshooting workshop
- Learning from "failures"
- A3 finalization strategies
- Peer Review #1 launch

---

## Pilot Study Gallery

**Round Robin Sharing (20 minutes)**

**3 minutes per person:**
1. **What you tested** - brief method overview
2. **What worked** - successes and good surprises
3. **What didn't work** - challenges and failures
4. **Key learning** - most important insight from pilot

**Listen for patterns across projects**

---

## Celebrating "Failures"

---

### Reframing Pilot "Failures"

**"My simulation didn't work"**
→ *You discovered software limitations before wasting weeks*

**"I couldn't get the data I wanted"**
→ *You identified realistic data constraints for your field*

**"My survey got no responses"**
→ *You learned about user engagement and incentive strategies*

**"My results made no sense"**
→ *You discovered measurement or analysis errors early*

---

### What Pilot "Failures" Teach Us

**Method validation:** Does this approach actually work?

**Resource estimation:** How long do things really take?

**Skill requirements:** What knowledge/training do you need?

**Quality control:** How can you ensure reliable results?

**Scope adjustment:** What's realistic vs. aspirational?

---

### Famous Research "Failures"

**Post-it Notes:** Failed super-strong adhesive became repositionable adhesive

**Microwave Oven:** Radar magnetron accidentally melted chocolate bar

**Penicillin:** Contaminated bacterial culture led to antibiotic discovery

**Key insight:** Unexpected results often lead to important discoveries

---

## Troubleshooting Workshop

---

### Common Pilot Challenges

**Software issues:**
- Installation and compatibility problems
- Learning curve steeper than expected
- Output formats difficult to analyze
- Results don't match expectations

**Data collection problems:**
- Access permissions denied
- Data quality lower than anticipated
- Sample sizes smaller than planned
- Missing information or variables

---

### Problem-Solving Strategies

**Software troubles:**
- Try simpler alternatives or web-based tools
- Focus on key analyses rather than comprehensive modeling
- Partner with classmates who have complementary skills
- Use preset examples to validate your approach

**Data access issues:**
- Shift to publicly available datasets
- Use case studies from literature
- Create synthetic examples for method testing
- Collaborate for mutual data access

---

### Adaptive Research Design

**The research spiral:**
1. Plan based on best available information
2. Test with small pilot study
3. Learn from unexpected results
4. Revise approach based on learning
5. Repeat with refined method

**This is normal and good research practice!**

---

## Group Troubleshooting

---

### Breakout Sessions

**Self-organize by challenge type:**
- **Software/simulation issues** 
- **Data access and collection**
- **Analysis and interpretation**
- **Scope and feasibility**

**15 minutes:** Share specific problems and brainstorm solutions

**10 minutes:** Report back key solutions to full group

---

### Resource Sharing

**What's working well:**
- Which tools/approaches are user-friendly?
- Where have you found good data sources?
- What shortcuts save time without losing quality?
- Who has expertise to share?

**Mutual aid opportunities:**
- Data collection partnerships
- Software skill sharing
- Access permission sharing
- Method validation collaboration

---

## A3 Finalization Strategy

---

### A3 Structure Reminder

**Part 1: Research Design** (1.5-2 pages)
- Refined research questions and hypotheses
- Method selection and justification
- Data collection protocol
- Analysis plan

**Part 2: Pilot Study Results** (1-1.5 pages)
- What you actually did
- What worked and what didn't
- Key learning and insights
- Revised approach for A4

---

### Writing Your Pilot Results

**Be honest about challenges:**
- Document problems you encountered
- Explain what you tried to solve them
- Acknowledge limitations of your pilot

**Focus on learning:**
- What did you discover about your method?
- How did pilot results change your understanding?
- What would you do differently next time?

**Show adaptability:**
- How did you revise your approach?
- What alternative strategies did you develop?
- How will pilot learning inform your A4?

---

### Turning Problems into Contributions

**If your simulation crashed:** Compare manual calculations to identify software limitations

**If your survey failed:** Analyze why and propose better engagement strategies

**If your data was incomplete:** Develop frameworks for handling missing information

**If your scope was too big:** Create prioritization criteria for future research

---

## Method Documentation Best Practices

---

### Reproducibility Requirements

**Step-by-step protocols:**
- Exact software versions and settings
- Data sources and collection procedures
- Analysis workflows and decision rules
- Quality control and validation steps

**Materials and resources:**
- Required tools and their alternatives
- Time and skill requirements
- Access permissions and constraints
- Troubleshooting guides

---

### Documentation Templates

**For simulation studies:**
- Model setup parameters and assumptions
- Input data sources and processing
- Analysis scripts or procedures
- Output validation and interpretation

**For survey/observational studies:**
- Recruitment and sampling procedures
- Data collection instruments and protocols
- Analysis approaches and coding schemes
- Privacy and ethical considerations

---

## Peer Review #1 Launch

---

### Peer Review Process

**Week 6-7:** Exchange A3 drafts for peer review

**Review focus:**
- Method clarity and feasibility
- Pilot learning integration
- Research design strength
- Documentation completeness

**Deliverable:** 1-page review memo with specific feedback

---

### Review Assignment Process

**Random pairing:** You'll be assigned a classmate's A3 to review

**Timeline:**
- **Monday Week 6:** Receive partner assignment and A3 draft
- **Wednesday Week 6:** Submit peer review memo
- **Friday Week 6:** Receive feedback on your A3

**Use feedback to strengthen your A3 final submission**

---

### Effective Peer Review Guidelines

**Read for understanding first:**
- What is the research question?
- What method did they use?
- What did they learn from their pilot?

**Provide constructive feedback:**
- What works well in their approach?
- What could be clearer or stronger?
- What questions do you have about their method?
- What suggestions do you have for improvement?

---

## Data Analysis Preview

---

### From Pilot to Full Analysis

**Scale up what worked:**
- Expand successful pilot procedures
- Apply lessons learned to larger dataset
- Maintain quality controls that proved effective

**Address pilot limitations:**
- Develop solutions for identified problems
- Strengthen weak aspects of your approach
- Plan for challenges you now anticipate

---

### Analysis Planning

**Statistical analysis:**
- What comparisons will you make?
- What statistical tests are appropriate?
- How will you handle uncertainty and variability?

**Visualization planning:**
- What charts/graphs will best show your results?
- How will you communicate uncertainty?
- What format will stakeholders find most useful?

---

### Quality Assurance

**Sanity checks:**
- Do results fall within expected ranges?
- Are patterns consistent with theory/literature?
- Do different analysis approaches give similar results?

**Peer validation:**
- Can others understand and replicate your approach?
- Do independent analyses reach similar conclusions?
- Are interpretations reasonable and justified?

## Reflection Questions

- What's the most important thing you learned from your pilot?
- How has your understanding of your research question changed?
- What are you most confident about in your approach now?
- What aspect still feels most uncertain?

## Key Takeaways

1. **"Failures" are valuable learning** - embrace unexpected results
2. **Adapt methods based on pilot experience** - rigid plans often break
3. **Document everything** - your struggles help others avoid similar problems
4. **Peer collaboration strengthens research** - share resources and expertise
5. **Quality over quantity** - better to do less well than more poorly
