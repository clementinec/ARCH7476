## Why Evidence Matters Now

- **Climate crisis** demands performance optimization
- **Complex buildings** need systematic analysis
- **Diverse users** require inclusive design validation
- **Tight budgets** need justified decisions
- **Professional liability** requires documented reasoning

---

## Evidence-Based Design Examples

---

### Example 1: Window Design

**Traditional approach:**

- Copy successful precedents
- Apply rules of thumb
- Adjust based on complaints

**Evidence-based approach:**

- Measure daylight performance
- Survey user satisfaction
- Compare energy consumption
- Optimize based on data

---

### Example 2: Workplace Layout

**Traditional approach:**

- Follow space planning standards
- Design for average user
- Adjust post-occupancy

**Evidence-based approach:**

- Observe actual usage patterns
- Test alternative configurations
- Measure productivity impacts
- Iterate based on evidence

---

### Example 3: Public Space Design

**Traditional approach:**

---

### Assignment Progression

### Optional: Python Primer

Interested in coding? Try the beginner notebooks:

- Python + ML Basics — `notebooks/01_python_ml_basics.ipynb`

## Generative Design is not Magic
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Magic_circle.png){width=400}

> It’s about making design decisions with evidence — data, simulations, and thresholds.  

::: notes
Students often think “generative” = black-box AI magic. Clarify from the start: this course is about reproducibility, clarity, and decision usefulness.

## Case 1 – Apple Park Glass Walls

*Employees at Apple Park kept walking into the pristine curved glass walls.*  

::: notes
NYT (2018) reported multiple incidents. A design that looked flawless in renders failed human factors testing.  
If the object is “transparent façade,” a decision claim might be: *“Does a subtle coating reduce accidents without losing daylight?”*  
:::

## Case 2 – Daylight as a Design Asset
<!-- ![](https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/5db0/cf95/3312/fd6d/4500/003f/newsletter/feature_1.jpg?1571887372){width=600} -->

*WELL Building Standard pushes daylight for health. Tech firms compete for daylight-rich workspaces.*  

::: notes
Wired & Architectural Digest covered how big firms prioritize daylight to boost productivity and health.  
Evidence links daylight exposure to sleep and wellbeing.  
Prompt: *“If your object is window size, how do you test daylight vs. glare trade-offs?”*

---

## Case 3 – Heat Resilience in Cities

*Paris 2022: heatwaves forced rethink of shade, airflow, and public space.*  

::: notes
Architectural press documented how shade structures and surface materials affect thermal comfort.  
Evidence can guide claims like: *“Does increasing tree cover by 20% reduce perceived heat stress?”*

## Case 4 – AI Hype vs. Evidence

*Generative AI renders go viral — but few are tested for buildability.*  

::: notes
Dezeen and WIRED highlight seductive AI-generated architecture images.  
But are they ventilated? Do they meet comfort codes?  
Prompt: *“If your object is an AI render, what evidence claim would you test first?”*

## Case 5 – Energy Retrofits as Evidence
![](https://s3-prod.crainsnewyork.com/styles/width_792/s3/Law97-062719.jpg){width=600}

*NYC Local Law 97 sets strict emission thresholds for buildings.*  

::: notes
Architectural Record covered how retrofits must now meet numeric CO₂ caps.  
Policy itself provides evidence: thresholds like *≤ 0.9 W/m²K* for adoption.  
Ask students: *“If your object is insulation, what’s your adopt/defer threshold?”*  
:::

---

## Activity: Your First Object Claim
- Sketch 2–3 possible **objects** from your studio or interest  
- Draft one **decision claim** (1–2 sentences)  
- Share with a peer, refine, and keep notes  

::: notes
This activity seeds A1 (Decision Claim). Encourage variety: glazing, HVAC rules, shading devices, workflow scripts. Students leave Week 1 with a concrete starting point.  
:::
