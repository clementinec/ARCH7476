## Welcome to ARCH7476

**Evidence-Based Generative Design**

*Data-Driven Decision Making in Architecture*

---

## Today's Agenda

- Course introduction and expectations
- "Generative design is not magic"
- Why evidence matters in architecture  
- Examples in plain language
- Setting up for semester success

---

## Course Philosophy {.center}

> "Generative design is not magic" â€” it requires evidence, testing, and systematic evaluation.

## The Current Reality

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**How decisions are made now:**

- Precedent and intuition
- "Best practices" 
- Aesthetic preference
- Client demands
- Budget constraints
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**What's missing:**

- Systematic testing
- Performance validation
- User feedback integration
- Data-driven optimization
- Evidence documentation

## Why Evidence Matters Now

- **Climate crisis** demands performance optimization
- **Complex buildings** need systematic analysis
- **Diverse users** require inclusive design validation
- **Tight budgets** need justified decisions
- **Professional liability** requires documented reasoning

---

## Evidence-Based Design Examples

---

### Example 1: Window Design

**Traditional approach:**

- Copy successful precedents
- Apply rules of thumb
- Adjust based on complaints

**Evidence-based approach:**

- Measure daylight performance
- Survey user satisfaction
- Compare energy consumption
- Optimize based on data

---

### Example 2: Workplace Layout

**Traditional approach:**

- Follow space planning standards
- Design for average user
- Adjust post-occupancy

**Evidence-based approach:**

- Observe actual usage patterns
- Test alternative configurations
- Measure productivity impacts
- Iterate based on evidence

---

### Example 3: Public Space Design

**Traditional approach:**

- Apply urban design principles
- Design for intended use
- Hope for the best

**Evidence-based approach:**

- Study user behavior patterns
- Test design interventions
- Measure social outcomes
- Scale successful strategies

---

## Course Structure

---

### Four Major Assignments

**A1: Decision Claim** (Week 2)
: Identify design object + testable claim

**A2: Evidence Map** (Week 4)
: Map existing evidence + identify gaps

**A3: Test Plan + Pilot** (Week 5)
: Design method + pilot test

**A4: Final Package** (Week 12)
: Complete research brief for stakeholders

---

### Assignment Progression

    A3 --> A4[Final<br/>Package]
```

Each assignment builds directly on the previous one

---

### Support Structure

- **Office hours**: Wednesdays 4-6pm, KB722
- **Peer review**: Built into schedule
- **Mentor dialogue**: Week 8 external consultation
- **Object Fair**: Week 12 public presentation

---

## Tools and Technology

---

### Tool Flexibility Philosophy

We emphasize **solving problems**, not **mastering software**

Choose tools that match:

- Your experience level
- Your research question  
- Available time/resources
- Stakeholder needs

---

### Low-Code Options

**Spreadsheets**: Excel, Google Sheets

- Data organization and basic analysis
- Charts and simple visualizations
- Decision matrices and comparisons

**QGIS**: Free GIS software

- Spatial analysis and mapping
- Buffer/clip operations
- Data visualization on maps

---

### Code-Heavy Options

**Python/Jupyter**: For advanced analysis

- Automated data processing
- Statistical analysis and machine learning
- Custom visualization and reporting

**GitHub**: For reproducible workflows

- Version control for research
- Collaboration and sharing
- Documentation and transparency

---

### Building Performance Tools

**Simulation Presets**:

- Radiance/VELUX (daylighting)
- EnergyPlus Simple Glazing (energy)
- Climate Consultant (weather analysis)

**Measurement Tools**:

- Environmental sensors
- Building management systems
- User survey platforms

---

## Getting Started

---

### This Week's Tasks

**Before next class:**

1. Install basic tools (Excel/Sheets, QGIS - where applicable)
2. Read: *Craft of Research* excerpts (available online)
3. **Draft seed idea for A1** - design object + initial claim
4. Explore course website and resources

---

### Brainstorming Your A1 Topic

Think about design decisions that intrigue you:

- What performance questions do you have?
- What design "rules" would you like to test?
- What stakeholders need better evidence?
- What decisions are architects struggling with?

---

### Good A1 Topics

**Window-to-wall ratios** in Hong Kong residential towers

- Testable performance impacts
- Clear stakeholders (developers, residents)
- Available data sources

**Ceiling height** in collaborative workspaces

- Measurable user outcomes
- Industry relevance
- Feasible testing approach

---

### Topic Development Questions

1. **What specifically** are you investigating?
2. **Who** would use this evidence to make decisions?
3. **How** could you test your ideas this semester?
4. **Why** does this matter for architectural practice?

---

## Questions & Discussion

What design decisions are you curious about?

What evidence would help you make better design choices?

---

## Next Week Preview

**Week 2: Finding and Framing Data**

- Data sources for architecture
- Ethics and privacy considerations
- Setting ranges and parameters
- **A1 Decision Claim due**

---

### Office Hours

**Wednesdays 4-6pm, KB722**
*Or by appointment*

Come discuss:

- A1 topic development
- Tool selection and setup
- Research question refinement
- Technical challenges

---

## Welcome to Evidence-Based Design!

*Let's make architecture more systematic, more effective, and more responsive to the people who use our buildings.*
