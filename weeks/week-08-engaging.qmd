## 🔥 Horror Stories from the Field

**Before we become champions, let's learn from the fallen...**

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Real Disasters from Professional Practice

**Case 1: The $2M Simulation Disaster**

- Major firm loses client because simulation crashed
- Original analyst left firm, took all knowledge
- No documentation = 3 months to recreate work
- **Client's response**: "How can we trust your process?"

**Case 2: The Plot Ratio Panic**

- Hong Kong development approval based on complex analysis
- Planning department asks: "How did you calculate this?"
- **Answer**: "Uh... Jennifer knew, but she's on maternity leave"
- **Result**: 6-month delay, $10M holding costs
:::

**📊 Quick Poll**: Raise your hand if you've EVER struggled to remember what you did in a project from 3+ months ago

*[Expected: Most hands up]*

**The reality**: If YOU can't reproduce your work, nobody can!

---

## 💀 The Reproducibility Graveyard

**⚰️ Tragic Examples from Your Peers:**

*"I used some version of Grasshopper but I can't remember which plugins..."*

*"The analysis worked perfectly but now the file won't open..."*

*"I know I changed some settings but I can't remember which ones..."*

*"My brilliant Excel formula broke when I opened it on a different computer..."*

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Group Confession Time

**Stand up and share** (30 seconds each): What's YOUR most embarrassing "I can't reproduce my own work" moment?

**Rules**: 
- Be honest! 
- No judgment zone
- Funniest story gets a prize! 🎁
:::

**The lesson**: Documentation isn't just nice to have - it's professional survival!

## 🏃 The 10-Minute Method Challenge

**⏰ You have 10 minutes to document ONE key workflow so clearly that a competitor could beat you with it!**

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Challenge Rules

**Pick ONE workflow** from your project (the most complex/critical one):

- 📐 Grasshopper simulation setup
- 📊 Survey data analysis 
- 🎨 Visualization creation
- 📈 Statistical analysis
- 🔍 Literature review process

**Your mission**: Write step-by-step instructions that a RIVAL TEAM could follow to get exactly your results

**Evil twist**: You'll actually SWAP instructions with someone who has never seen your method!
:::

**Timer starts... NOW!** ⏱️
