- Individual mentor consultations (30-45 min each)
- Reproducibility capsule development
- Mid-semester reflection

---

## The Reproducibility Challenge

---

### Why Document Workflows?

**For others:**
- Enable replication and verification
- Allow adaptation to new contexts
- Build on your methods and findings
- Learn from your successes and failures

**For yourself:**
- Remember what you did 6 months later
- Adapt methods for future projects
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Demonstrate professional competence

---

### Levels of Documentation

**Bare minimum:** Someone could repeat exactly what you did
**Better:** Someone could adapt your approach to similar problems
**Best:** Someone could improve on your methods and share innovations

**Target for this course:** *Better* level documentation

---

## Workflow Documentation Best Practices

---

### Step-by-Step Process Documentation

**For each major workflow step:**
1. **Purpose:** Why is this step necessary?
2. **Inputs:** What do you need to start?
3. **Process:** Exactly what do you do?
4. **Outputs:** What do you produce?
5. **Quality checks:** How do you verify success?
6. **Troubleshooting:** What goes wrong and how to fix it?

---

### Tool and Software Documentation

**Version control:**
- Software versions and build numbers
- Operating system and hardware specs
- Plugin/package versions and dependencies
- Settings and configuration files

**Alternative approaches:**
- What tools could substitute?
- What's essential vs. convenient?
- How to adapt for different skill levels?
- Free vs. paid alternatives?

---

### Decision Documentation

**Document judgment calls:**
- Parameter selections and justifications
- Assumption choices and alternatives considered
- Quality thresholds and acceptability criteria
- Trade-off decisions and reasoning

**Make implicit knowledge explicit:**
- When do you know results "look right"?
- How do you prioritize when time is limited?
- What shortcuts are acceptable vs. problematic?

---

## Automation Ethics and Limits

---

### Appropriate Automation

**Good automation targets:**
- Repetitive calculations and data processing
- Quality control checks and validation
- Report generation and formatting
- Data visualization and chart creation

**Benefits:**
- Reduces human error
- Increases consistency
- Saves time for analysis and interpretation
- Enables sensitivity analysis and exploration

---

### Automation Cautions

**Maintain human oversight:**
- Automated results still need interpretation
- Algorithms can perpetuate biases
- Context and nuance require human judgment
- Stakeholder communication needs human touch

**Transparency requirements:**
- Document automated processes clearly
- Explain algorithm choices and limitations
- Maintain ability to do manual checks
- Acknowledge automation in methods

---

### AI and LLM Integration

**Appropriate uses:**
- Code debugging and syntax help
- Literature search and summarization
- Writing assistance and clarity improvement
- Method explanation and documentation

**Inappropriate uses:**
- Generating fake data or results
- Making design recommendations without human validation
- Replacing critical thinking and analysis
- Presenting AI output without verification

---

## Individual Mentor Consultations

---

### Consultation Structure

**30-45 minutes per student with external practitioner**

**Preparation required:**
- Brief project summary (1 page)
- Specific questions for practitioner
- Draft results or findings to discuss
- Implementation context questions

**Documentation:**
- Take notes during consultation
- Follow up with thank you and summary
- Integrate insights into A4 development

---

### Maximizing Consultation Value

**Come prepared with specific questions:**
- How do practitioners handle similar problems?
- What evidence would be most convincing to clients?
- How do you communicate uncertainty to decision-makers?
- What implementation barriers should be anticipated?

**Focus on practical application:**
- How would your findings be used in practice?
- What format would be most useful for practitioners?
- How can research be integrated into design workflows?
- What validation or follow-up would be needed?

---

## Mentor Report Requirements

---

### Report Structure (1-2 pages)

**Consultation summary:**
- Who you spoke with and their background
- Key questions you asked
- Main insights and advice received

**Integration plan:**
- How will mentor feedback influence your A4?
- What recommendations will you incorporate?
- What new perspectives did you gain?

**Implementation considerations:**
- What practical barriers were identified?
- How might you address these in future work?
- What follow-up or validation would be needed?

---

### Professional Networking

**Building relationships:**
- Connect on LinkedIn with permission
- Follow up with project results when complete
- Ask about informational interviews for career planning
- Consider mentorship opportunities

**Giving back:**
- Acknowledge mentor contributions in final report
- Share interesting findings that might help their practice
- Offer to present results to their team if relevant
- Document lessons learned for future students

---

## Reproducibility Capsule Workshop

---
