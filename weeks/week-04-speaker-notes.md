# Week 4 Speaker Notes: Sensitivity & Peer Check
**Duration:** 60 minutes total
**Key Theme:** Moving from technical analysis to stakeholder-engaged research

---

## Opening (5 minutes) - Slides 1-3

**Energy:** Start high, acknowledge the holiday make-up session

**Key Message:** "Today we're going to solve the biggest problem I saw in your A1 assignments - the gap between talking about stakeholders and actually engaging them."

**Speaker Notes:**
- Mention you've finished grading A1 - overall excellent technical thinking
- But almost everyone struggled with the same thing: stakeholder specificity
- Today is about bridging that gap for A3
- Keep energy high since it's a make-up session

**Timing:** Keep intro brief, students want to dive in

---

## A2 Gallery Walk (10 minutes) - Slide 4

**Format:** Quick stand-up presentations (2-3 minutes each)
**Your role:** Listen for stakeholder gaps, note patterns

**What to listen for and call out:**
- Who mentioned specific people vs. categories?
- Who has actual contact plans vs. vague intentions?
- Where do technical findings connect to stakeholder priorities?

**Transition:** "I'm hearing great technical insights, but let's talk about what I noticed in A1..."

---

## The Stakeholder Reality Check (15 minutes) - Slides 5-11

### **Slide 5: What We Observed in A1** (3 minutes)
**Be direct but encouraging:**
- "Your technical thinking was strong - that's not the issue"
- "The gap is in moving from 'community engagement' as a buzzword to actual community engagement as a research method"
- Use specific examples from their submissions (anonymized)

**Energy:** Constructive but frank - they need to hear this

### **Slide 6: The Community Engagement Trap** (4 minutes)
**Present this as a pattern, not a specific story:**
- Frame it as a common pattern you see repeatedly in practice
- Reference actual research: "Post-occupancy evaluation studies show this pattern"
- Pause after describing the workshops: "Sound familiar?"
- Emphasize the key point: asking WHAT they want vs. HOW they'll know it works
- Connect to their studio projects: "How many of you have done this?"

**Audience engagement:** Ask for show of hands on who has community engagement in their brief

**Factual backing:** You can reference actual POE literature that documents this pattern - Wolfgang Preiser's work on facility performance evaluation consistently shows this gap.

### **Slide 7: Studio Projects vs. Real Stakeholders** (3 minutes)
**Make this interactive:**
- Ask them to read their brief language out loud
- Have them answer the bullet point questions about their actual project
- Most will realize they don't have good answers - that's the point

### **Slides 8-11: Stakeholder Mapping** (5 minutes)
**Keep this practical:**
- Have them think about their specific project while you explain
- Use the Hong Kong office tower example - everyone can relate to view vs. comfort
- Emphasize that this isn't just consultation - it's research methodology

---

## Metrics That Matter (10 minutes) - Slides 12-16

### **Slide 12: The Measurement Problem** (2 minutes)
**Be specific:** Call out actual language from A1 submissions
- "I saw variations of these exact phrases in your assignments"
- "The problem isn't that you don't care about measurement - it's that you haven't connected measurement to stakeholder priorities"

### **Slides 13-14: Types of Metrics & Examples** (4 minutes)
**Use the library example actively:**
- Walk through each metric type
- Ask: "Who cares about which metric?"
- Point out how different stakeholders would prioritize differently

### **Slide 15: Metrics You Can Actually Measure** (4 minutes)
**Be practical:**
- "You're not writing a PhD dissertation - you need semester-feasible approaches"
- Connect each category to their likely projects
- Emphasize observation and surveys as most accessible

---

## Understanding Sensitivity (8 minutes) - Slides 17-21

### **Slide 17: What is Sensitivity Analysis** (2 minutes)
**Frame the shift:**
- Traditional sensitivity = technical
- Stakeholder sensitivity = social/political
- Both matter for real-world implementation

### **Slides 18-19: Types & Example** (4 minutes)
**Use the window example actively:**
- Start with technical questions they'd normally ask
- Then add stakeholder dimension
- Show how the same technical data leads to different conclusions

### **Slide 20: The View vs. Comfort Dilemma** (2 minutes)
**Tell this as a story:**
- Set up the technical findings first
- Then reveal the stakeholder complexity
- Ask: "Who wins? How do you decide?"
- Connect to their projects: "Where do you have similar conflicts?"

---

## Community Engagement Planning (8 minutes) - Slides 22-25

### **Slide 22: The Engagement Spectrum** (2 minutes)
**Be diagnostic:**
- "Most projects start at Information Sharing"
- "Most think they're at Consultation"
- "Evidence-based projects need Collaboration"
- Ask them to self-assess their current approach

### **Slide 23: The 5-Question Framework** (3 minutes)
**Make this a mini-exercise:**
- Have them answer question 1 about their project right now
- Most can't name specific people - that's the learning moment
- "If you can't answer question 1, you're not ready for evidence collection"

### **Slide 24: Practical Engagement for A3** (3 minutes)
**Connect to their timeline:**
- "This is what you should be doing in the next 2 weeks"
- Be specific about 3-5 interviews, not dozens
- Emphasize documentation and iteration

---

## Peer Review Workshop (10 minutes) - Slides 26-30

### **Setup** (2 minutes)
**Be clear about the new structure:**
- Traditional peer review + stakeholder accountability
- Phase 2 is the new element focused on their A1 gaps
- Partners should be constructively critical

### **Phase 1: Method Exchange** (3 minutes)
**Your role:** Move around, listen for stakeholder gaps, prompt questions

### **Phase 2: Stakeholder Reality Check** (3 minutes)
**Your role:** Jump in when you hear vague answers, push for specificity
- "When you say 'community' - who exactly?"
- "How will you know if they're satisfied?"

### **Phase 3: Critical Feedback** (2 minutes)
**Traditional peer review focus**

---

## Wrap-up & Looking Ahead (4 minutes) - Slides 31-32

### **Key Takeaways** (2 minutes)
**Emphasize the shift:**
- From technical-focused to stakeholder-engaged evidence
- From consultation to collaboration
- From vague metrics to specific measurement

### **Questions & Discussion** (2 minutes)
**Target the new content:**
- Focus questions on stakeholder engagement planning
- Ask for specific commitments: "Who will you interview this week?"

---

## Timing Notes

**If running ahead:**
- Spend more time on the engagement planning exercise
- Have students work through the 5-question framework for their project
- Do more detailed peer review rounds

**If running behind:**
- Combine slides 8-11 into shorter stakeholder mapping overview
- Reduce peer review to just the stakeholder reality check phase
- Focus Q&A on immediate A3 planning needs

**Energy management:**
- Break after slide 16 if energy dips (around 35 minutes)
- Use the case studies as energy boosters - tell them as stories
- Keep students engaged with direct questions about their projects

---

## Key Examples to Emphasize

1. **The Community Engagement Pattern** (Slide 6) - Shows the gap between consultation and collaboration
2. **Hong Kong Office Tower** (Slide 20) - Demonstrates stakeholder vs. technical conflicts
3. **Daylighting Case Study** (Slides 31-32) - Shows how multiple stakeholders complicate "simple" technical decisions

**Delivery tips:**
- Present as recognizable patterns, not specific stories unless you have verified details
- Use research-backed examples (POE studies, published case studies)
- Connect each back to their studio projects
- Ask "Does this sound familiar?" after each one
- For the HK office tower example, you can make it more specific since this is a common local scenario

## Common Student Questions & Responses

**Q: "My studio brief already includes community engagement requirements"**
**A:** "That's great - but does it specify HOW you'll measure successful engagement? Most briefs say 'engage' but don't define what evidence would show you succeeded."

**Q: "I don't have access to real stakeholders for my studio project"**
**A:** "Then your A3 should acknowledge that limitation and focus on what you CAN measure. But you'd be surprised - most 'inaccessible' stakeholders are actually reachable if you're specific about what you're asking."

**Q: "How many people do I need to interview?"**
**A:** "Quality over quantity. 3-5 targeted interviews with the right people beats 20 random surveys. Focus on stakeholders who actually influence decisions about your design object."

**Q: "What if my stakeholders disagree about success metrics?"**
**A:** "That's exactly what your research should uncover! Document the disagreement - it's often more valuable than consensus. Show how design decisions affect different groups differently."
