## A2 Progress Check

**Quick sharing:** What's the most surprising thing you've found in your literature review so far?

Common patterns:
- Less evidence than expected?
- Contradictory findings?
- Methodological limitations?
- Contextual gaps?

---

## Testing Approaches: Proxy vs. Preset

---

### What is a "Test" in Design Research?

**A systematic comparison** designed to evaluate competing alternatives or validate design assumptions.

Not just "trying things out" â€” but structured investigation with:
- Clear hypotheses
- Controlled comparisons  
- Measurable outcomes
- Documented methods

---

### Proxy Testing

**Using simplified models or representations** to understand performance relationships

**Examples:**
- Physical scale models in wind tunnel
- Simple energy models with key variables
- Mock-ups of spatial configurations
- User testing with prototypes or scenarios

**Advantages:**
- Lower cost and faster iteration
- Focus on key relationships
- Easier to control variables

---

### Preset Simulation Testing

**Using established software tools** with validated models and standard inputs

**Examples:**
- EnergyPlus for building energy analysis
- Radiance for daylighting simulation
- CFD for airflow and thermal comfort
- Acoustic modeling for sound performance

**Advantages:**
- Validated algorithms and physics
- Industry-standard metrics
- Comprehensive analysis capabilities

## The Pre-Registration Mindset

---

### What is Pre-Registration?

**Documenting your research plan** before conducting the study, including:
- Research questions and hypotheses
- Methods and analysis approach
- Success criteria and interpretation rules
- Potential limitations and biases

**Purpose:** Prevent cherry-picking results and ensure transparent research

---

### Pre-Registration for Design Research

**Document before testing:**
1. **Specific claims** you're testing
2. **Alternative explanations** you'll consider
3. **Metrics and thresholds** for decision-making
4. **Analysis approach** you'll use
5. **Potential confounding factors**

**Benefits:**
- Clearer thinking about research design
- More credible results
- Better documentation for replication

---

### Pre-Registration Template

**Research Question:** What exactly are you testing?

**Hypotheses:** What do you predict will happen?

**Methods:** How will you conduct the test?

**Analysis Plan:** How will you interpret results?

**Success Criteria:** What results would support/refute your claim?

**Limitations:** What factors might affect validity?

### Simulation Best Practices

**Start simple:**
- Use default values for secondary parameters
- Focus on key design variables
- Validate with known cases

**Document everything:**
- Model assumptions and simplifications
- Input parameter sources
- Version numbers and settings

**Check results:**
- Do outputs make physical sense?
- Compare to benchmarks or rules of thumb
- Identify sensitivity to key assumptions

---

## Test Design Workshop

---

### Exercise: Design Your Test

**Individual work (15 minutes):**

Using your A1 decision claim, draft:
1. **Specific hypothesis** - what exactly are you predicting?
2. **Test approach** - proxy, preset, or hybrid method?
3. **Key variables** - what will you compare or vary?
4. **Success metrics** - how will you measure outcomes?
5. **Potential challenges** - what could go wrong?

---

### Peer Review

**Pairs (15 minutes):**

Exchange test plans and provide feedback:
- Is the hypothesis testable with the proposed method?
- Are the variables and metrics appropriate?
- What assumptions might need validation?
- What alternative explanations should be considered?
- How could the approach be simplified or strengthened?

---

### Common Test Design Challenges

**Scope creep:**
- Trying to test too many variables at once
- Expanding beyond semester constraints
- Perfect vs. good enough analysis

**Method mismatch:**
- Complex tools for simple questions
- Simple tools for complex questions
- Unfamiliar software with steep learning curves

**Validation gaps:**
- No way to check if results make sense
- Missing baseline or comparison cases
- Insufficient documentation for replication
