## Quick Statistics Refresher 
### (Because A3 Showed We Need This!)

---

### Slide 1: Hypotheses - Like Design Claims You Can Test

**🏗️ Think of a hypothesis like saying: "My design will work better than existing solutions"**

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**In Architecture:**


- "This office layout will improve productivity"

- "Better lighting will reduce eye strain"

- "Open spaces will increase collaboration"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**In Statistics:**


- **H0 (Null)**: "No difference" (old design = new design)

- **H1 (Alternative)**: "There IS a difference" (new design > old design)
:::

:::

**🎯 Your job**: Collect enough evidence to **reject H0** (prove the old way is NOT as good)

::: {.callout-note}
## Analogy: Court Trial

- **H0** = "Defendant is innocent" (default assumption)

- **H1** = "Defendant is guilty" (what you're trying to prove)

- You need **overwhelming evidence** to reject innocence
:::

**Real Example**: "Biophilic design increases worker satisfaction by >0.5 points on 5-point scale"

- **H0**: Biophilic = Traditional (no difference)

- **H1**: Biophilic > Traditional (satisfaction increase ≥0.5)

---

### Slide 2: T-tests - Your Evidence Judge

**🎯 T-test = "Is this difference REAL or just random luck?"**

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
**What it does:**


- Compares two groups (old vs. new design)

- Accounts for natural variation in data

- Gives you a **p-value** (probability it's just luck)

**The Magic Number**: p < 0.05

- "Less than 5% chance this is random"

- "Pretty confident the difference is real"
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Architecture Example:**


- Test 20 people in old office

- Test 20 people in new office  

- Productivity scores: 6.2 vs 7.1

- **Question**: Is 0.9 difference real?

- **T-test says**: p = 0.032 ✅

- **Conclusion**: Yes, probably real!
:::

:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Analogy: Coin Flipping
If you flip 10 heads in a row, is the coin rigged? 

- **Probability of this by chance**: 1/1024 = 0.001

- **Way less than 0.05** → Coin is probably rigged!
:::

**Common Mistake**: "My 3 test users liked it better" ≠ statistical significance!

---

### Slide 3: Sample Size - How Many People Do You Actually Need?

**🎲 The Goldilocks Problem: Not too few, not too many, just right**

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Too Small (n < 10):**

- ❌ Can't detect real differences

- ❌ Results change drastically with one more person

- ❌ No statistical power

**Too Large (n > 100):**

- ✅ Very reliable BUT...

- 💰 Expensive and time-consuming

- 🤯 May detect differences that don't matter practically
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Just Right (n = 20-50 for most studies):**

- ✅ Can detect meaningful differences

- ✅ Manageable cost and time

- ✅ Reliable enough for decisions

**Quick Rules of Thumb:**


- **Pilot studies**: 10-15 people minimum

- **User testing**: 20-30 people

- **Survey research**: 30+ people

- **Big differences**: Fewer people needed

- **Small differences**: More people needed
:::

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Analogy: Restaurant Reviews

- **3 reviews**: Not enough to trust

- **30 reviews**: Pretty reliable picture

- **300 reviews**: Overkill for most decisions, but very reliable
:::

**Power Calculation Tools**: G*Power (free software) - tells you exactly how many you need!

**A3 Reality Check**: Most of you needed 20-30 people minimum, not 8-12! 📊

---

## Peer Review Lightning Round

**🔥 2-Minute Partner Share** 
*Find someone you haven't worked with yet*

**Round 1**: What was the **most surprising** piece of feedback you received? 
**Round 2**: What was the **most actionable** suggestion?
**Round 3**: What feedback did you **respectfully disagree** with and why?

::: {.callout-warning}
## Class Poll Time!
Raise your hand if peer feedback made you:

- 🔄 Change your method significantly

- 🎯 Refocus on different stakeholders  

- 📊 Redesign your data visualization

- 🤔 Question your original claim
:::

**Now let's see what patterns we can spot across all projects...**

---

## The Great Threshold Disasters of Architecture

---

### Case Study Battle: When Good Evidence Goes Bad

**🏗️ The Pruitt-Igoe Housing Complex (1954-1976)**

- **Evidence**: "High-density housing improves urban efficiency"

- **Threshold**: "500+ units per acre is optimal"

- **Reality**: Social dysfunction, crime, eventual demolition

- **Missing**: Social interaction thresholds, community scale limits

**❄️ The Champlain Towers South Collapse (2021)**

- **Evidence**: "Concrete structures last 50+ years with basic maintenance"

- **Threshold**: "Visual inspection every 10 years is sufficient"

- **Reality**: Catastrophic failure after 40 years

- **Missing**: Accelerated corrosion thresholds in coastal environments

::: {.callout-note}
## Discussion Prompt
**Think-Pair-Share (5 mins)**: What architectural decision in your own project could go catastrophically wrong if you set the wrong threshold? What's your "Pruitt-Igoe" scenario?
:::

---

### Threshold Reality Check: The Hong Kong Context

**🏙️ Local Case Study: Hong Kong's Plot Ratio Limits**

- **Current threshold**: 5:1-8:1 in urban areas

- **Evidence basis**: Transportation capacity, infrastructure load

- **Controversy**: Does this create housing shortage vs. livability?

**💡 Your Turn - Rapid Fire Questions:**

*Stand up and move to different corners of the room:*

**Corner A**: "My threshold is based on regulations/codes"
**Corner B**: "My threshold is based on user satisfaction data" 
**Corner C**: "My threshold is based on economic analysis"
**Corner D**: "My threshold is... honestly, I'm not sure yet"

*Now defend your corner choice to the other groups! (3 mins each)*

---

## Setting Appropriate Thresholds

---

### Regulatory and Standards-Based

**Building code compliance:**

- Minimum performance requirements

- Apply regulatory or market requirements

---

### 📊 Live Decision Matrix Showdown

**Real-time class voting on trade-off weights!**

*Use your phones to vote on Mentimeter/Kahoot:*

**Question 1**: For a Hong Kong residential developer, rank importance (1-5):

- Energy performance: ?

- Construction cost: ?

- User satisfaction: ?

- Maintenance ease: ?

- Resale value: ?

**Live Results Display**:

| Alternative | Energy (X%) | Cost (Y%) | User Sat (Z%) | Maintenance (W%) | **Total** |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| High-tech   | 9           | 3         | 8             | 6                | **?**     |
| Standard    | 6           | 8         | 7             | 8                | **?**     |
| Budget      | 4           | 10        | 5             | 9                | **?**     |

**Plot twist**: Now recalculate with class-voted weights!

::: {.callout-important}
## Reality Check
How different are the results with class weights vs. your individual assumptions? What does this tell us about stakeholder engagement?

### 🎯 The Scenario Planning War Games

**🎲 Choose Your Adventure Format**

*Each student rolls a die to get their scenario assignment:*

**🌟 Best Case (Roll 1-2)**: "Everything Goes Perfect"

- All assumptions optimistic, technology works flawlessly

- Stakeholders embrace change, funding flows freely

- **Your mission**: Sell this vision BUT acknowledge it's optimistic

**⚡ Worst Case (Roll 3-4)**: "Murphy's Law Strikes"

- Technology fails, budgets get cut, regulations change

- Users resist, maintenance breaks down, economy crashes

- **Your mission**: Plan for disaster WITHOUT being paralyzed

**🎯 Most Likely (Roll 5-6)**: "Reality Check"

- Some things work, some don't, typical implementation friction

- Mixed stakeholder response, moderate budget pressure

- **Your mission**: Balance optimism with pragmatism

**The Challenge**: Present your scenario in 90 seconds with:
1. What happens in your scenario
2. How your recommendation changes
3. What contingency plans you need

**Class votes**: Which scenario team was most convincing?

::: {.callout-warning}
## Professional Reality
Real clients want to know you've thought through all scenarios. Being overly optimistic OR pessimistic kills credibility.
