## 🎬 Welcome to the Story Wars! {.center}

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Today's Epic Battle: Who Tells the Best Story?

**The Ultimate Challenge**: Transform your semester of hard work into a story so compelling that busy decision-makers will stop scrolling social media to listen

**The Weapons**: Two slides, killer visuals, and narrative superpowers

**The Stakes**: Professional credibility, stakeholder buy-in, and Object Fair domination

# Round 1: The Great Story Disasters {background-color="#8B0000"}

---

## 💀 When Good Research Goes Bad (Story Edition)

**Before we become storytelling champions, let's learn from the narrative graveyard...**

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Real-World Presentation Disasters

**🏢 Case 1: The $50M Miscommunication**

- PhD researcher presents brilliant energy analysis to Hong Kong developer board
- **45 minutes** of technical methodology explanation
- **30 seconds** on what this means for their bottom line
- **Board's response**: "Interesting... but what should we actually DO?"
- **Result**: No adoption, project shelved, researcher never invited back

**📊 Case 2: The Chart Catastrophe**

- Consultant shows 47 different charts to planning committee
- **Every chart** technically perfect, statistically sound
- **No chart** tells decision-makers what action to take
- **Committee response**: "We're more confused than when we started"
- **Result**: Status quo wins, innovative solution dies
:::

**🤔 Reality Check**: How many of your presentations focus more on HOW you did it than WHY anyone should care?

---

## 🎯 The Two-Slide Death Match

**⚡ The challenge**: Distill your ENTIRE semester into exactly 2 slides that would make a busy stakeholder stop what they're doing and take action

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Battle Stations: Choose Your Story Structure

**Move to corners of the room based on your current approach:**

**🔥 Action Corner**: "I start with what they should DO"

**📊 Evidence Corner**: "I start with what I FOUND"

**😰 Problem Corner**: "I start with what's WRONG"

**🤷 Confusion Corner**: "I honestly have NO IDEA how to start"

**3 minutes to convince other corners why YOUR approach wins!**
:::

**Plot twist**: We'll test which structure actually WORKS with real stakeholders!

---

## 🎬 The Story Structure Science

**🧠 Cognitive Science Reality**: Human brains process stories in predictable patterns

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[😴 Stakeholder: Busy & Distracted] --> B{🎯 Hook: Why Should I Care?}
    B -->|Interested| C[📊 Evidence: What Did You Find?]
    B -->|Bored| D[💀 Lost Forever]
    C --> E[💡 Action: What Should I Do?]
    E --> F[✅ Success: Stakeholder Convinced]
    C -->|Confused| G[😵 Overloaded & Confused]
    E -->|Vague| H[🤔 Interested But No Action]
```

**⏰ You have 15 seconds** to grab attention or lose them forever!

# Round 2: Narrative Structure Wars {background-color="#4B0082"}

---

## 🥊 The Structure Showdown: 3 Competing Frameworks

### 🎯 Framework A: "Stakeholder-First" Structure

**Slide 1**: "Here's YOUR problem and why it costs you money/time/reputation"

**Slide 2**: "Here's exactly what to DO about it (with confidence levels)"

### 📊 Framework B: "Evidence-First" Structure

**Slide 1**: "Here's the surprising thing I discovered in the data"

**Slide 2**: "Here's what this means for your decisions"

### 🎭 Framework C: "Story Arc" Structure

**Slide 1**: "The journey from problem to discovery to solution"

**Slide 2**: "Your roadmap to implementation and success"

::: {.callout-important}
## Live Testing Laboratory

We're going to TEST these frameworks with REAL scenarios! Each team gets 5 minutes to create the same content using different structures, then we vote on which is most convincing!
:::

---

## 🧪 The Structure Laboratory Experiment

**🎲 Scenario Assignment** (roll dice for your test case):

**1-2: Hong Kong Housing Developer**

- Stakeholder: Policy-focused, public accountability, political constraints
- Decision: Whether to approve innovative building performance standards

**⏰ 15 minutes**: Create 2-slide pitch using assigned framework

**🎯 Test**: Present to "stakeholder" (classmate in role), get real feedback

## ⚡ Speed Chart Battle Royale

**🚨 Current Disaster**: 

![Terrible Chart Example](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjMwMCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj4KICAgIDxyZWN0IHdpZHRoPSI0MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMzAwIiBmaWxsPSIjZjBmMGYwIi8+CiAgICA8dGV4dCB4PSIyMDAiIHk9IjE1MCIgZm9udC1mYW1pbHk9IkFyaWFsIiBmb250LXNpemU9IjE0IiB0ZXh0LWFuY2hvcj0ibWlkZGxlIj5UZXJyaWJsZSBDaGFydCBXaXRoIFRvbyBNdWNoIERhdGE8L3RleHQ+Cjwvc3ZnPg==)

**Problems with this chart:**
- 47 different data series (seriously!)
- No clear message or takeaway
- Tiny text, confusing colors
- Overwhelming for stakeholders

**⏰ 10-minute transformation challenge!**

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Speed Chart Rescue Formula

1. **One Message Rule**: What's the ONE thing stakeholders need to know?
2. **3-Second Test**: Key insight obvious immediately?
3. **Annotation Strategy**: Use text to guide interpretation
4. **Color Purpose**: Every color choice supports the message
5. **Context Connection**: How does this relate to stakeholder decisions?
:::

**🏆 Judging**: Present your transformation in 60 seconds!

---

## 🎯 The 3-Second Message Test

**🧠 Brain Science**: Stakeholders form first impressions in 3 seconds

**Challenge**: Create figures that pass the "conference coffee break test"

*Scenario: Busy stakeholder walks past your poster with coffee, glances for 3 seconds while walking. Do they "get it"?*

### 🏃 Live Testing Protocol

1. **Create your figure** (10 minutes)
2. **Speed dating rounds** (30 seconds each):
   - Show figure to classmate for exactly 3 seconds
   - They write down what they understood
   - Compare to your intended message
3. **Iterate rapidly** based on feedback
4. **Championship round**: Best 3-second clarity wins!

::: {.callout-warning}
## Common 3-Second Failures

❌ **Chart Title**: "Analysis of Building Performance Metrics Across Various Scenarios"

✅ **Chart Title**: "South-facing offices need blinds to prevent glare"

❌ **Chart Message**: Hidden in data, requires interpretation

✅ **Chart Message**: Annotated, highlighted, impossible to miss
