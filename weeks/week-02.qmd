---

### Practical Ethics Guidelines

1. **Be transparent** about data collection purposes
2. **Get permission** before photographing people or private spaces
3. **Anonymize** personal information whenever possible
4. **Store securely** using HKU-approved systems
5. **Document clearly** what you collected and how

## Setting Ranges and Parameters

---

### Defining Your Investigation Scope

**Spatial boundaries**
- What buildings, neighborhoods, or regions?
- Indoor vs. outdoor conditions?
- Public vs. private spaces?
- Scale of analysis (room, building, district)?

**Temporal boundaries**
- What time periods (seasons, daily cycles)?
- Historical vs. contemporary data?
- Snapshot vs. longitudinal analysis?
- Peak vs. average conditions?

---

### Parameter Selection

**Performance metrics**
- Energy use intensity (kWh/mÂ²/year)
- Thermal comfort (temperature, humidity, air speed)
- Daylighting (illuminance, daylight factor, glare)
- User satisfaction (Likert scales, preference ratings)

**Design variables**
- Building characteristics (age, size, orientation)
- System specifications (HVAC, lighting, envelope)
- Spatial configurations (layout, ceiling height, windows)
- Usage patterns (occupancy, activities, schedules)

---

### Quality Control Considerations

**Data reliability**
- Measurement accuracy and calibration
- Sample size and representativeness
- Missing data and outlier handling
- Consistency across different sources

**Validity checks**
- Do measurements match expected ranges?
- Are user responses consistent and logical?
- Do findings align with known relationships?
- Can results be replicated or verified?

---

## Framing for Stakeholder Audiences

---

### Understanding Your Stakeholders

**Primary decision-makers**
- Who will directly use your evidence?
- What decisions are they trying to make?
- What constraints and pressures do they face?
- How do they currently evaluate alternatives?

**Secondary audiences**
- Who else is affected by these decisions?
- What outcomes matter most to different groups?
- Where might priorities conflict?
- How can you address multiple perspectives?

---

### Stakeholder-Specific Framing

3. **Stakeholder concerns** that would shape your approach
4. **Ethical considerations** for your data collection

---

### Peer Discussion

**Small groups (15 minutes):**

Share your data source ideas and get feedback:
- Are the sources realistic and accessible?
- Do the parameters match the research question?
- Are there alternative or better data sources?
- What challenges might you encounter?

---

### Group Report-Out

**Brief sharing (10 minutes):**

Each group shares:
