## My Role: Technical Coach

**Not a research director**

- You develop research questions & architectural concepts
- I provide computational implementation guidance
- Focus: making ambitious ideas **achievable**

**Requirements:**

- Programming capability (Python)
- Willingness to learn tools
- Persistence through technical obstacles

---

## What I Supervise

**✅ YES - Data-driven computational projects:**

- ML for building energy prediction/optimization
- Time series analysis of occupant behavior
- Deep learning for thermal comfort prediction
- IoT + predictive analytics for responsive buildings
- Validated simulations with working code

---

**❌ NO - Theoretical or conceptual work:**

- "AI as design inspiration" projects
- Traditional design without computational core
- Purely theoretical computational potential

---

## Project Requirements

**Must include ALL three:**

1. **Actual datasets** - not hypothetical data
2. **Working code** - functional implementation
3. **Validation** - measurable outcomes

**Suitable building types:**

- Residential, commercial, institutional
- Where performance optimization is central
- Technology focus: hardware OR software

---

## Solve 

**Problem:** Multiple disconnected ambitions

- Comprehensive lineup of technologies across IoT, AI and spatial design
- Multiple "AI tools" without domain challenge mapped out clearly


**Reality check:**

- Which specific problem are you actually solving?
- Where is your training data coming from?
- What makes this better than current/stock methods?

---

## Focused Alternative (Hypothetical)

**Instead of:** "AI workflow for better design"

**Consider:** "Can ML predict degredation horizon of cultral heritage buildings better than traditional methods?"

**This is:**

- ✅ Specific and testable
- ✅ Has available datasets (government energy data)
- ✅ Stakeholder-relevant (heritage + sustainability)
- ✅ Achievable in one thesis

---

## Takeaways for all

1. **Define ONE specific research question**
2. **Confirm data availability** before proposing
3. **Demonstrate technical feasibility** early
4. **Connect to real stakeholder needs**

**My commitment:** Technical coaching to make your focused idea work
