# Essential Tools

## Software Installation

### Required for All Students
- **Spreadsheet software**: Excel (HKU license) or Google Sheets (free)
- **QGIS**: Free, open-source GIS software ([download here](https://qgis.org/))
- **Web browser**: Chrome or Firefox for online tools

### Optional Advanced Tools
- **Python + Jupyter**: For students interested in coding ([Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/))
- **GitHub Desktop**: For version control and reproducibility ([download here](https://desktop.github.com/))
- **R + RStudio**: Alternative to Python for statistical analysis

### Building Performance Tools
- **Radiance**: Advanced daylighting simulation (optional)
- **EnergyPlus**: Building energy modeling with Simple Glazing GUI
- **Climate Consultant**: Climate analysis tool (free from UCLA)

## Installation Support
- **Office hours**: Individual troubleshooting available (Wednesdays 4-6pm, KB722, or by appointment)
- **Student tech support**: Peer mentoring for software issues
- **HKU IT services**: Campus-wide software licensing and support
- **Online tutorials**: Video guides for common installation issues

# Python Primer Notebooks (Optional)

Two beginner-friendly notebooks with fake datasets you can run locally:

- Python + ML Basics: `notebooks/01_python_ml_basics.ipynb`
- Architecture Viz + Analysis: `notebooks/02_arch_viz_analysis.ipynb`

Quick start (terminal):

1) Create environment and install packages

```bash
# From repo root
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Launch Jupyter Lab/Notebook and open the files under `notebooks/`

```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

Notes:
- Fake CSVs live in `data/`. Replace with your data using the same column names to reuse code.
- The word cloud will gracefully fall back to a bar chart if the `wordcloud` package isn’t installed.
- Error bars compute 95% CIs; if SciPy isn’t available, a standard 1.96 z-score fallback is used.

Suggested alignment with the course:
- Week 1–2: Run the ML Basics to grasp train/test splits and cross-validation.
- Week 5–7: Use the Viz + Analysis notebook to turn pilot results into stakeholder-ready figures (with uncertainty).
