# Assignment Overview

**A1: Decision Claim** establishes the foundation for your semester-long research brief. You will identify a specific design object (building element, space type, or system) and articulate a testable claim about its performance, impact, or optimal configuration. This assignment focuses on **problem framing** — converting design intuitions into questions that evidence can answer.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

1. **Identify a suitable design object** at an appropriate scale for evidence-based investigation
2. **Frame a testable claim** that can be evaluated with available data and methods
3. **Define stakeholders** who would benefit from evidence about your claim
4. **Articulate the decision context** where your evidence would be applied
5. **Scope your investigation** realistically within course constraints

# What Is a "Decision Claim"?

A **decision claim** connects a specific design choice to a measurable outcome that matters to identifiable stakeholders. It moves beyond aesthetic preference to ask: *What evidence would help us choose between alternatives?*

## Good Decision Claims Have Four Elements:

### 1. **Design Object** (What you're investigating)
- Specific enough to test systematically
- Broad enough to generate useful evidence
- Accessible for data collection within semester timeframe

**Examples:**
- Window-to-wall ratios in Hong Kong residential towers
- Ceiling height in collaborative workspaces  
- Green roof configurations for urban buildings
- Wayfinding signage systems in hospital environments

### 2. **Performance Dimension** (What you're measuring)
- Clearly defined and measurable
- Connected to stakeholder concerns
- Achievable with available tools and methods

**Examples:**
- Energy performance, daylighting quality, thermal comfort
- User satisfaction, space utilization, productivity metrics
- Construction cost, maintenance requirements, lifecycle impact

### 3. **Stakeholder Group** (Who needs this evidence)
- Specific decision-makers who would use your findings
- Clear understanding of their constraints and priorities
- Realistic access for validation and feedback

**Examples:**
- Residential developers in dense urban markets
- Corporate facility managers optimizing workplace design
- Hospital administrators balancing patient outcomes and costs
- Municipal planners developing green infrastructure policies

### 4. **Decision Context** (When/how evidence would be applied)
- Real situations where choices must be made
- Clear alternatives being compared
- Specific decision criteria and trade-offs

**Examples:**
- Early design phase when major systems are being selected
- Retrofit decisions for existing building portfolios
- Policy development requiring performance standards
- Post-occupancy evaluation informing future projects

# Assignment Requirements

## Core Deliverables

### Part 1: Problem Statement (1 page)

Write a clear, concise problem statement addressing:

**Design Object Description**
- What specifically are you investigating? (Be precise about scale, typology, context)
- Why is this object/system/space important in contemporary practice?
- What design variables or alternatives will you focus on?

**Current Decision-Making Process**
- How are decisions about this object typically made now?
- What information do decision-makers currently use?
- What gaps or uncertainties exist in current practice?

**Proposed Claim**
- State your testable claim in one clear sentence
- Explain why you believe this claim might be true (initial hypothesis)
- Identify what evidence would support or refute your claim

### Part 2: Stakeholder Analysis (1 page)

Identify and analyze your primary stakeholders:

**Primary Decision-Makers**
- Who would directly use your evidence to make design decisions?
- What are their main concerns, constraints, and success criteria?
- How do they currently evaluate alternatives for your design object?

**Secondary Stakeholders**
- Who else is affected by decisions about your design object?
- What outcomes matter most to these groups?
- How might their priorities conflict with primary decision-makers?

**Evidence Requirements**
- What type of evidence would be most convincing to your stakeholders?
- What level of precision/confidence would they require?
- What format would make your findings most actionable for them?

### Part 3: Scope and Constraints (0.5-1 page)

Realistically assess what you can accomplish this semester:

**Available Resources**
- What data sources are accessible to you?
- What tools and methods can you realistically learn and apply?
- What time and budget constraints will shape your approach?

**Manageable Scope**
- How will you narrow your investigation to be achievable?
- What limitations will you acknowledge upfront?
- What would constitute "success" for this project?

### Part 4: Visual Summary (1 page)

Create a single-page visual that communicates:
- Your design object with key variables highlighted
- Your proposed claim as a testable question
- Your primary stakeholders and their decision context
- The type of evidence you plan to collect

This can be a diagram, infographic, or annotated photographs — choose the format that best communicates your concept.

# Differentiated Expectations

While all students complete the same core deliverables, expectations vary by program level:

## Undergraduate Students
- **Focus:** Clear problem identification with instructor guidance
- **Scope:** Well-defined, smaller-scale objects (single building element or system)
- **Stakeholders:** Primary focus on one main stakeholder group
- **Evidence:** Straightforward metrics accessible through existing data or simple measurement

## MArch Students  
- **Focus:** Professional memo format suitable for practice contexts
- **Scope:** Building-scale or neighborhood-scale investigations
- **Stakeholders:** Multiple stakeholder groups with competing priorities
- **Evidence:** Industry-relevant metrics and decision criteria

## PhD Students
- **Focus:** Research question suitable for systematic investigation
- **Scope:** Multi-building or policy-scale questions
- **Stakeholders:** Complex stakeholder networks including regulatory bodies
- **Evidence:** Methodologically rigorous approaches with uncertainty quantification

# Examples of Strong Decision Claims

## Example 1: Residential Energy Performance
**Design Object:** Window-to-wall ratios in Hong Kong high-rise residential buildings  
**Claim:** "Optimizing window-to-wall ratios can reduce residential cooling energy by 15-25% while maintaining acceptable daylighting levels"  
**Stakeholders:** Residential developers, building owners, energy policy makers  
**Decision Context:** Early design phase for new residential developments

## Example 2: Workplace Productivity
**Design Object:** Open office acoustics and spatial configuration  
**Claim:** "Strategic placement of acoustic treatments can improve reported productivity by 20% without major space reallocation"  
**Stakeholders:** Corporate facility managers, workplace designers, HR departments  
**Decision Context:** Office renovation decisions and workplace strategy planning

## Example 3: Public Space Usage
**Design Object:** Seating arrangements in urban plazas  
**Claim:** "Flexible seating configurations increase space utilization by 40% compared to fixed bench arrangements"  
**Stakeholders:** Urban planners, park departments, public space designers  
**Decision Context:** Public space design guidelines and renovation priorities

# Common Pitfalls to Avoid

## Scope Issues
- **Too broad**: "How to design sustainable buildings" (instead: focus on one specific system/element)
- **Too narrow**: "The optimal paint color for my bedroom" (instead: scale up to stakeholder relevance)
- **Too abstract**: "How to make beautiful architecture" (instead: focus on measurable performance)

## Claim Problems
- **Untestable**: Claims about aesthetic preference or cultural meaning
- **Already proven**: Well-established relationships documented in literature
- **Impossible to measure**: Outcomes requiring unavailable data or methods

## Stakeholder Misalignment
- **No real stakeholders**: Academic exercise without practical application
- **Unrealistic access**: Stakeholders who won't engage with student research
- **Mismatched priorities**: Evidence that doesn't address stakeholder concerns
