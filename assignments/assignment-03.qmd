# Assignment Overview

**A3: Test Plan + Pilot Study** translates the evidence gaps identified in A2 into a concrete research method. You will design a systematic approach to test your A1 decision claim, conduct a small-scale pilot to validate your method, and refine your approach based on initial results. This assignment develops **method design skills** and **adaptive planning** essential for reliable evidence collection.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

1. **Design appropriate research methods** matched to your decision claim and evidence gaps
2. **Plan systematic data collection** with clear protocols and quality controls
3. **Conduct pilot testing** to validate methods and identify implementation challenges
4. **Adapt research plans** based on pilot results and practical constraints
5. **Document methods** clearly enough for reproduction and peer review

# What Is a "Test Plan + Pilot"?

A **test plan** is your systematic strategy for collecting evidence to evaluate your decision claim. It specifies:
- Exactly what data you will collect and how
- What comparisons you will make to test your claim  
- How you will ensure data quality and reliability
- What analysis approaches you will use

A **pilot study** is a small-scale trial of your test plan that helps you:
- Verify that your methods work in practice
- Identify unexpected challenges and solutions
- Refine your protocols before full implementation
- Estimate time, cost, and resource requirements

Think of this as **engineering your research** — designing a reliable system for generating trustworthy evidence.

# Common Challenges and Solutions

## Challenge: "My pilot didn't work at all"
**This is actually good news!** Pilots are supposed to reveal problems.
**Solutions:**
- Document exactly what went wrong and why
- Develop alternative approaches based on what you learned
- Simplify your method to something more manageable
- Focus on the most important aspects of your original plan
- Frame pilot "failure" as valuable methodological learning

## Challenge: "I can't get access to data/buildings/people"
**Solutions:**
- Develop backup options with easier access requirements
- Scale down to publicly accessible examples
- Use existing datasets or published case studies
- Partner with classmates for mutual data access
- Focus on method development rather than comprehensive data collection

## Challenge: "My results are boring/inconclusive"
**Solutions:**
- Inconclusive results are still results — document why
- Look for unexpected patterns or interesting secondary findings
- Consider what additional data would clarify results
- Frame inconclusive results as identifying needs for future research
- Focus on validating your method rather than proving your claim

## Challenge: "I don't have time/resources to do what I planned"
**Solutions:**
- Prioritize the most important aspects of your research question
- Document what you would do with more time/resources
- Do a smaller-scale but higher-quality study
