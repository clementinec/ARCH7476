### MArch Students
- Focus on practical design decision memos
- Emphasize real-world client communication
- Connect to professional practice standards

### Undergraduate Students  
- Guided scaffolding with templates and examples
- Low-code tools (spreadsheets, preset simulations)
- Extra support sessions available

### PhD Students
- Deeper engagement with uncertainty analysis and statistical methods
- Advanced reproducibility requirements
- Code-heavy workflow options encouraged
- Additional methodological rigor expected

## Equivalent Outcomes
All students produce the same core deliverables (A1-A4) but with technical depth and methodological sophistication appropriate to their program level and experience.
