# Assignment Structure

The course is organized around **four major assignments** that build systematically toward a comprehensive evidence-based design research brief. Each assignment scaffolds skills and knowledge needed for the next, culminating in a professional-quality research package.

## Assignment Timeline

| Assignment | Due Week | Weight | Focus |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|
| [A1: Decision Claim](assignments/assignment-01.qmd) | Week 2 | 15% | Problem framing |
| [A2: Evidence Map](assignments/assignment-02.qmd) | Week 4 | 20% | Literature & gap analysis |
| [A3: Test Plan + Pilot](assignments/assignment-03.qmd) | Week 5 | 25% | Method design & pilot |
| [A4: Final Package](assignments/assignment-04.qmd) | Week 12 | 40% | Complete research brief |

## Assignment Progression

### Building Knowledge Systematically

Each assignment builds directly on previous work:

**A1 → A2**: Your decision claim from A1 becomes the focus of your evidence mapping in A2

**A2 → A3**: Gaps identified in A2 inform the testing approach designed in A3  

**A3 → A4**: Pilot results from A3 guide the full analysis and recommendations in A4

### Accommodating Different Backgrounds

While all students complete equivalent assignments, expectations for technical depth vary:

- **Undergraduate students**: Guided templates, low-code tools, extra scaffolding
- **MArch students**: Professional memo format, practical decision focus  
- **PhD students**: Advanced methodological rigor, code-heavy options encouraged

## Core Skills Developed

### A1: Decision Claim
- **Problem identification**: Recognizing design decisions that benefit from evidence
- **Question framing**: Converting design intuitions into testable claims
- **Stakeholder analysis**: Understanding who needs to be convinced and why

### A2: Evidence Map  
- **Literature review**: Finding and synthesizing relevant existing evidence
- **Gap analysis**: Identifying what evidence is missing or inadequate
- **Research planning**: Setting up systematic investigation of gaps

### A3: Test Plan + Pilot
- **Method design**: Choosing appropriate data collection and analysis approaches
- **Pilot execution**: Testing methods on a small scale before full implementation
- **Iteration**: Adjusting plans based on pilot results and constraints

### A4: Final Package
- **Analysis**: Systematic evaluation of evidence against decision criteria
- **Communication**: Presenting findings to different audiences effectively  
- **Reproducibility**: Documenting process for verification and replication
- **Decision support**: Making clear recommendations with stated confidence levels

## Assessment Philosophy

### Evidence-Based Grading
Assignments are evaluated using the same evidence-based thinking taught in the course:

- **Clear criteria**: Rubrics specify exactly what constitutes different performance levels
- **Multiple perspectives**: Peer review, self-assessment, and instructor evaluation
- **Iterative improvement**: Change logs track learning and revision processes
- **Transparent reasoning**: Feedback explains the evidence behind grades

### Professional Standards
All assignments prepare students for real-world architectural practice:

- **Client communication**: Practice explaining technical findings to non-experts
- **Professional formatting**: Industry-standard document structure and presentation
- **Ethical responsibility**: Transparent limitations and appropriate confidence claims
- **Collaborative process**: Peer review mirrors professional design team dynamics

## Support Structure

### Ongoing Support
- **Office hours**: Wednesdays 4-6pm at KB722, or by appointment
- **Peer review**: Structured feedback sessions built into the schedule
- **Mentor dialogue**: Mid-semester consultation with external practitioner
- **Technical workshops**: Just-in-time support for tools and methods

### Flexibility and Accommodation
- **Tool choice**: Low-code and code-heavy options for different comfort levels
- **Topic flexibility**: Wide range of design objects and scales acceptable
- **Timeline accommodation**: Extensions available for documented need
- **Alternative formats**: Accessibility accommodations available on request

## Quality Standards

### Research Brief Excellence
By the end of A4, successful work demonstrates:

1. **Clear problem definition** with stakeholder needs understood
2. **Systematic evidence collection** using appropriate methods  
3. **Rigorous analysis** with uncertainty appropriately acknowledged
4. **Actionable recommendations** with clear decision thresholds
5. **Professional communication** accessible to intended audiences
6. **Reproducible process** documented for verification

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Confirmation bias**: Testing only ideas you already believe
- **Method mismatch**: Using complex tools for simple questions (or vice versa)
- **Communication gaps**: Technical accuracy without audience awareness
- **Overconfidence**: Making strong claims from limited evidence
- **Irreproducibility**: Methods too vague or idiosyncratic to replicate
