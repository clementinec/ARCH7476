(Be precise about scale, typology, context) - Why is this object/system/space important in contemporary practice? - What design variables or alternatives will you focus on?\nCurrent Decision-Making Process - How are decisions about this object typically made now? - What information do decision-makers currently use? - What gaps or uncertainties exist in current practice?\nProposed Claim - State your testable claim in one clear sentence - Explain why you believe this claim might be true (initial hypothesis) - Identify what evidence would support or refute your claim\n\n\nPart 2: Stakeholder Analysis (1 page)\nIdentify and analyze your primary stakeholders:\nPrimary Decision-Makers - Who would directly use your evidence to make design decisions? - What are their main concerns, constraints, and success criteria? - How do they currently evaluate alternatives for your design object?\nSecondary Stakeholders - Who else is affected by decisions about your design object? - What outcomes matter most to these groups? - How might their priorities conflict with primary decision-makers?\nEvidence Requirements - What type of evidence would be most convincing to your stakeholders? - What level of precision/confidence would they require? - What format would make your findings most actionable for them?\n\n\nPart 3: Scope and Constraints (0.5-1 page)\nRealistically assess what you can accomplish this semester:\nAvailable Resources - What data sources are accessible to you? - What tools and methods can you realistically learn and apply? - What time and budget constraints will shape your approach?\nManageable Scope - How will you narrow your investigation to be achievable? - What limitations will you acknowledge upfront? - What would constitute “success” for this project?\n\n\nPart 4: Visual Summary (1 page)\nCreate a single-page visual that communicates: - Your design object with key variables highlighted - Your proposed claim as a testable question - Your primary stakeholders and their decision context - The type of evidence you plan to collect\nThis can be a diagram, infographic, or annotated photographs — choose the format that best communicates your concept.",

Do they meet comfort codes?\nPrompt: “If your object is an AI render, what evidence claim would you test first?”",
