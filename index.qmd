## Course Overview

**ARCH7476: Evidence-Based Design** explores how architects can make better design decisions through systematic data collection, analysis, and interpretation. This course bridges the gap between intuitive design thinking and empirical evidence, preparing students to justify design choices with quantitative and qualitative data.

### Course Philosophy

> "Generative design is not magic" â€” it requires evidence, testing, and systematic evaluation.

Modern architectural practice increasingly demands evidence-based decision making. Whether optimizing building performance, validating design assumptions, or communicating with clients and stakeholders, architects need skills in data collection, analysis, and presentation.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Frame architectural problems** as testable research questions
2. **Collect and analyze data** relevant to design decisions
3. **Design and conduct tests** to evaluate design alternatives
4. **Communicate findings** effectively to diverse audiences
5. **Document workflows** for reproducible design research
6. **Apply ethical frameworks** to data collection and use in architecture

### Mixed Audience Approach

This course serves students across different programs:

- **MArch students**: Focus on practical design decision memos and real-world applications
- **Undergraduate students**: Guided scaffolding with low-code tools and preset simulations
- **PhD students**: Deeper engagement with uncertainty analysis, reproducibility, and advanced workflows

All students produce equivalent deliverables, but technical depth and methodological rigor flex according to experience and program requirements.

## Course Structure

### Core Assignments

The course centers around four major assignments that build toward a comprehensive research brief:

**A1: Decision Claim** (Week 2)
: Identify a design object and articulate a testable claim about its performance or impact.

**A2: Evidence Map** (Week 4)  
: Map existing evidence and identify gaps requiring new data collection.

**A3: Test Plan + Pilot** (Week 5)
: Design and pilot a systematic test of your design claim.

**A4: Final Package** (Week 12)
: Complete research brief including Practice Case, Object Card, and Reproducibility Capsule.

### Pedagogical Approach

- **Learning by doing**: Each week combines conceptual frameworks with hands-on application
- **Peer review**: Multiple opportunities for peer feedback and collaborative learning
- **Mentor dialogue**: Mid-course consultation with external practitioners
- **Public presentation**: Final "Object Fair" with invited critics

### Tools and Technology

The course emphasizes **tool flexibility** rather than software mastery:

**Low-code options**: Excel/Sheets, QGIS, preset simulations (Radiance/VELUX, EnergyPlus Simple Glazing)

**Code-heavy options**: Python/Colab, GitHub workflows, custom analysis scripts

**Universal tools**: Visualization software, presentation platforms, documentation systems
